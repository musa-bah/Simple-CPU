# Simple-CPU
This is a school project for a simple CPU design in VHDL. This design includes the major components for the simple CPU and the rest of the component such as the memory and the complete computer testbench is provided by the Professor.
The code is written in VHDL and developed using the Xilinx SDK for windows. We used the Xilinx Spartan 3 board for testing it on a hardware. The code should work on most FPGA boards.
